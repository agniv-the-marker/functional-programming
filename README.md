# Won't you shake a poor Haskell's hand...?

This is the GitHub sync I've setup for my learning haskell, see [[Functional Programming]] for more! This will allow the website at [haskell.agniv.me](https://haskell.agniv.me) to have linked code, since the plug-in I'm using for this site currently doesn't love it.

Make sure to utilize [[re_linker.py]] before pushing this repository to the website, as it will fix links to code and redirect them here! Make sure to reload obsidian after running this, as otherwise the replacement feature won't immediately work.
