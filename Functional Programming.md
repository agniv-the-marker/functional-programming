This garden will contain my (agniv's) notes on Haskell, following some of the [course material from Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2023-2024/fp/), the [official guide](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/#set-up-a-haskell-development-environment) for haskell, and [learn you a haskell for a great good](https://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction)!

Use [[installing haskell]] to install, and check out [[ide support]] for vs-code specific extensions. Then you should check out [[running haskell]] for, well, obvious reasons. The vs-code extension needs vs-code to be reloaded so it can do `runghc`, because this skips over any complaints from the window's defender.

And yes, the site's favicon [[3d_haskell.svg]] is a poorly ai-generated rendition of a 3d logo for haskell :P. If you want to get back, click [here](agniv.me/obi).

To see the specifics:

- Oxford's course material ([[fp_notes.pdf]]) correlates with [[oxford functional programming]].
